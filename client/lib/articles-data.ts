What started as 3D in computer graphics has extended beyond the screens into the physical world with the emergence of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). They connect the virtual environment with our real world. Recently, AR and VR have become more widely used in the healthcare and education sectors, no longer just for gamers.

The global AR/VR market is projected to reach $46.6 billion in 2025 and could grow to over $220.99 billion by 2034. The rising demand for content management systems, all over the world, is driving the growth of the AR/VR software market. It was the AR software segment that dominated the market with the largest shares in the year 2024.

## Did you know?

**AR technology is used in Pokemon GO.** In this application, users can gather points by exploring real-world environments while holding up their smartphone in an attempt to locate, capture "Pokemon," which are connected to particular geographic locations.

## Understanding AR and VR

### Augmented Reality (AR)
**Augmented reality (AR)** overlays the digital elements onto the real world, allowing us to interact with it in a more natural way. With AR, Google lets us see a variety of creatures, such as dogs and lions. Snapchat uses augmented reality to provide filters and effects while taking pictures.

Superimposition-based AR partially or even fully replaces the original view of the object with an augmented view of the same object. It is very suitable for those who use their smartphone to experience an augmented version.

### Virtual Reality (VR)
**Virtual reality (VR)** takes the users into a digital environment, generating a fully artificial experience with the users cut off from the real world. With VR technology, we can create a virtual environment where users may play games or view movies. VR devices such as the Oculus Rift allow users to imitate the digital environment. With the help of a smartphone app called Google Tilt Brush, users can create 3D artwork in a virtual setting.

When it comes to selecting VR devices, the main importance is to select a device that is user-friendly, i.e. comfortable to wear, flexible in operations, and the viewing depth and visual experience has to provide a dynamic experience for the user.

## Did you know?
**Tuscany+ was the first tourism-specific app, designed to enhance visitor experiences using AR.**

Unlike VR, which requires a headset, AR is more user-friendly and accessible, as it can be used on smartphones.

Tracking sensors are essential to allow the user to roam in a real environment in order to move their viewpoint in AR/VR and be able to continuously update the location of the user in the virtual world. There are three major concepts involved in tracking the user: Six Degrees of Freedom (to detect the movement of a rigid body in 3D space), orientation, and coordinates of the object.

## Applications Across Industries

- **In education**, AR is being primarily used to create an interactive and engaging classroom environment for the students.

- **In gaming**, VR takes the top spot. Along with VR headsets, input devices like joysticks and bend-sensing gloves that track the user's hand gestures and track their position in the real environment to translate them into a virtual environment are being used. However, the output devices allow the user to see and hear everything that happens in the game. Games like Asgard's Wrath are often played using Meta VR headsets.

- **Brands like IKEA and Amazon** are leveraging their AR marketing campaign, allowing customers to try out their products before purchasing them.

- **NASA uses AR and VR technologies** to train their astronauts to take a walk on Mars.

- **The best thing about VR in the medical field**, is that using exposure therapies by a company called LIMBIX people have overcome anxiety and claustrophobia.

## Mixed Reality: The Future

> "Mixed reality is the third wave of computing after the personal computer and the smartphone." - Satya Nadella, CEO, Microsoft

**Mixed reality (MR)** is the merge of both AR and VR. MR allows us to bring the virtual elements into real world. One example of this is zSpace, an educational technology organization that uses MR for educational purposes. zSpace uses a monitor, a stylus, and special 3D glasses, using which the users can manipulate virtual components as they appear to pop out of the screen.

*Students improve their understanding of the subjects with the help of Mixed Reality (MR).*

## Challenges and Future Prospects

The major hurdles to overcome in the use of AR and VR are the cost of the VR headsets, motion sickness while using VR headsets, and privacy. AR and VR track the user's real-time position in the environment, raising questions about privacy.

Kois Center VR is currently working on developing an application that provides VR-based training for dental professionals through hyper-realistic virtual procedures. Samsung's Project Moohan XR headset is launching globally in October 2025. It blends augmented, virtual, and mixed reality on Android XR platform. This super cool gadget has lot of expectations in the tech community.

## The Age of Immersive Technology

AR and VR are not just trends, they build the prototype for how our future will connect to the world. There is hardly an area from education to gaming where the horizon for developing those applications does not seem limitless. Hence, when costs do come down and access increases, it is expected that, like every other aspect of our everyday life, AR and VR will basically change how we learn and work and play. We will soon see mixed reality, which is the integration of AR and VR, assisted with 5G support for infusing real-time interactions lag-free to provide the best of both worlds.

## 1. Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini have emerged as powerful tools in software development, capable of generating code from natural language prompts with surprising fluency. From assisting developers with routine scripting to solving advanced algorithmic problems, these models are increasingly embedded into IDEs, interview platforms, and educational tools. However, as their adoption expands, critical questions arise about the quality and reasoning behind the code they produce.

While much of the existing literature focuses on correctness, style, or functional completeness, an often-overlooked aspect is how deeply these models reason about algorithmic efficiency. Consider a prompt asking for a solution to find the shortest path in a graph or compute the nth Fibonacci number — will the LLM provide a naive recursive approach or an optimal dynamic programming solution?

This paper explores a hypothesis we term **simplicity bias**: the idea that LLMs tend to prefer simpler, easier-to-learn algorithms, even when more complex or optimal alternatives are expected. Such a bias could stem from the frequency distribution of training data, prompt phrasing, or the lack of explicit reasoning chains within the model's architecture. This behavior has profound implications — not only for the correctness and performance of AI-generated code but also for how developers evaluate and trust the suggestions these systems produce.

Through empirical evaluation on a curated set of coding problems, this study investigates the extent to which LLMs default to simplicity, how this varies across tasks and prompts, and what this reveals about the current state of algorithmic reasoning in modern code-generating AI systems.

## 2. Methodology

To investigate whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit a systematic bias toward simpler, suboptimal algorithms in code generation, we designed a structured empirical study. Our methodology was guided by the goal of simulating realistic coding prompt conditions across a diverse set of algorithmic problems, allowing us to isolate and analyze model behavior in a controlled yet representative environment.

### 2.1 Benchmark Problem Set

We curated a benchmark suite consisting of ten algorithmically significant problems, each with well-established naive and optimal solutions. These problems were selected based on their representation across different categories of algorithmic reasoning—ranging from recursion and dynamic programming to graph traversal and string processing.

| Problem | Naive Approach | Optimal Approach |
|---------|---------------|------------------|
| Fibonacci | Recursive | Dynamic Programming (Bottom-up / Memoization) |
| Sorting | Bubble Sort | Merge Sort / Quick Sort |
| Pathfinding | DFS / BFS | Dijkstra's / A* |
| Matrix Multiplication | Brute Force | Strassen's Algorithm |
| Prime Detection | Trial Division | Sieve of Eratosthenes |
| Subset Sum | Recursion | Dynamic Programming |
| String Matching | Naive | KMP / Rabin-Karp |
| GCD | Repeated subtraction | Euclidean Algorithm |
| Maximum Subarray | Brute Force | Kadane's Algorithm |
| Exponentiation | Repeated multiplication | Binary Exponentiation |

### 2.2 Language Models Evaluated

We selected two state-of-the-art LLMs commonly used for code generation tasks: **OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo** and **GPT-4**. Both models were accessed via the OpenAI API to ensure consistency in versioning and querying. An optional third model (Claude 3 or Gemini Pro) was considered for broader comparison but is not included in the core evaluation due to limited access during the experiment window.

### 2.3 Prompting Styles

To examine the influence of prompt phrasing on model output, we tested three distinct prompting strategies for each problem:

1. **Zero-shot**: A basic instruction prompt without context — e.g., *"Write a function to solve [problem]."*
2. **Few-shot**: The same instruction as above, but preceded by 1–2 solved examples of unrelated problems to provide the model with general code-writing context.
3. **Explicit Optimality Prompt**: The original prompt modified to explicitly request performance — e.g., *"Write the most efficient solution to [problem]."*

![Prompting Strategy Flow Layout](/research-images/llms-bias/image001.jpg)
*Figure 1: Prompting Strategy Flow Layout*

### 2.4 Evaluation Metrics

Each response was evaluated along four dimensions:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Correctness** | Does the code compile and produce correct output for test cases? |
| **Algorithm Type** | Is the algorithm naive or optimal in terms of time complexity? |
| **Efficiency** | Evaluated via theoretical asymptotic complexity and empirical execution time (where feasible). |
| **Code Complexity** | Code readability, use of constructs (recursion, memoization), depth of logic, and overall conciseness. |

### 2.5 Bias Scoring Metric

To quantify the extent of simplicity bias across the dataset, we introduce a metric called the **Simplicity Bias Score (SBS)**, defined as:

**SBS = (Number of simple (naive) solutions) / (Total number of valid (correct) solutions generated)**

An SBS close to 1.0 implies a strong tendency toward simpler or naive algorithms, while an SBS closer to 0.0 indicates a preference for optimal solutions. In this formulation, only correct (valid) code responses are considered in the denominator to ensure that the metric reflects algorithm choice rather than functional correctness.

This score was computed separately for each model (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) and for each prompting strategy (zero-shot, few-shot, and explicit-optimal). Comparing SBS across these dimensions enables us to evaluate how different prompting styles influence algorithmic reasoning, and whether more advanced models demonstrate reduced simplicity bias in practice.

## 3. Results & Observations

To assess how large language models respond to different prompt styles across a range of algorithmic tasks, we conducted a quantitative analysis based on the outputs collected from GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Each of the problems was posed using three distinct prompting styles: zero-shot, few-shot, and explicit optimality prompts. The solutions were evaluated based on algorithm type, efficiency, correctness, and code complexity.

### 3.1 Simplicity Bias Scores (SBS)

To quantify the tendency of LLMs to produce simpler solutions, we computed the Simplicity Bias Score (SBS), defined as the ratio of naive (simple) solutions to total valid outputs. A lower SBS indicates a stronger preference for optimal algorithms.

![Simplicity Bias Scores Chart](/research-images/llms-bias/image002.png)
*Figure 2: Simplicity Bias Scores Across Prompting Techniques*

| Model | Zero-shot | Few-shot | Explicit-optimal |
|-------|-----------|----------|------------------|
| GPT-3.5 | 0.80 | 0.67 | 0.40 |
| GPT-4 | 0.70 | 0.53 | 0.20 |

These scores indicate that zero-shot prompts consistently yielded the highest SBS values, suggesting that LLMs default to simpler solutions unless explicitly guided. GPT-4 consistently outperformed GPT-3.5 in selecting more optimal algorithms, particularly when efficiency was emphasized in the prompt.

### 3.2 Case Studies

To illustrate the SBS behavior more concretely, we highlight responses from selected problems:

![Algorithm Type Distribution](/research-images/llms-bias/image003.png)
*Figure 3: Algorithm Type Distribution per Problem Across Models*

| Problem | GPT-3.5 (Zero-shot) | GPT-4 (Zero-shot) | GPT-3.5 (Explicit Optimal) | GPT-4 (Explicit Optimal) | Expected Optimal Algo |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Fibonacci | Recursive | Recursive | DP (Memoization) | DP (Bottom-up) | Dynamic Programming |
| Sorting | Bubble Sort | Bubble Sort | Merge Sort | Quick Sort | Merge / Quick Sort |
| Pathfinding | DFS | BFS | Dijkstra | Dijkstra | Dijkstra / A* |
| Prime Detection | Trial Division | Trial Division | Sieve | Sieve | Sieve of Eratosthenes |
| Subset Sum | Recursive | Recursive | DP | DP | Dynamic Programming |
| String Matching | Naive | Naive | KMP | Rabin-Karp | KMP / Rabin-Karp |
| GCD | Subtraction | Subtraction | Euclidean Algo | Euclidean Algo | Euclidean Algorithm |
| Max Subarray | Brute Force | Brute Force | Kadane's | Kadane's | Kadane's Algorithm |
| Matrix Multiplication | Brute Force | Brute Force | - | Strassen (Partial) | Strassen's Algorithm |

### 3.3 Task Difficulty vs. Bias

We further categorized problem types by domain to study how task complexity affects LLM bias. Below are average SBS values for GPT-4 across different problem types:

| Task Type | Avg SBS (GPT-4) |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Math/DP-heavy | 0.65 |
| Sorting | 0.50 |
| Graph/Greedy | 0.45 |

LLMs showed a stronger preference for simpler solutions in math-heavy and dynamic programming problems. This suggests a lack of deep reasoning under default conditions, especially in domains that demand complexity awareness.

### 3.4 Prompt Style Impact

Prompting style played a significant role in mitigating simplicity bias. When asked explicitly for 'efficient' solutions, both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 produced more optimal implementations. However, such specificity is rare in typical development workflows, raising concerns about default model behavior in production contexts.

## 4. Conclusion

This study investigated whether large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 demonstrate a simplicity bias in algorithmic code generation. By evaluating model outputs across a curated set of algorithmic problems—each having both a naive and optimal implementation—we introduced and applied a Simplicity Bias Score (SBS) to quantify this tendency.

Our findings confirm the hypothesis: LLMs, especially in zero-shot conditions, tend to default to simpler algorithms such as recursive Fibonacci, bubble sort, or trial division. This bias persists even in models like GPT-4, though explicit prompting for optimality mitigates the effect significantly. Few-shot examples also improve performance but to a lesser extent than direct optimization requests.

### Key Implications

1. **Development Practices**: Developers should be aware of this bias when using LLMs for algorithmic tasks, especially in performance-critical applications.

2. **Prompt Engineering**: Explicit requests for efficiency or optimization can significantly improve the quality of generated algorithms.

3. **Model Training**: Future LLM development should consider incorporating more sophisticated algorithmic reasoning capabilities.

4. **Educational Impact**: This bias could affect how students learn algorithms if they rely heavily on LLM-generated solutions without understanding the trade-offs.

### Future Work

Further research should explore:
- The impact of this bias on real-world software development
- Methods to reduce simplicity bias during model training
- Comparative analysis across different LLM architectures
- Long-term effects on developer skills and algorithmic thinking

This research contributes to our understanding of LLM limitations and provides practical guidance for their effective use in software development contexts.

## Introduction

Shortest path algorithms are foundational in both theory and practice. They underpin applications ranging from internet routing and road navigation to compiler optimization and resource scheduling. The single-source shortest paths problem (SSSP) in particular asks: given a directed weighted graph G=(V,E) with non-negative edge weights, how can we efficiently compute the minimum distance from a source vertex s to every other vertex?

For decades, the fastest known deterministic solution for sparse graphs was Dijkstra's algorithm, with runtime O(m+nlogn) when implemented with efficient priority queues. The log n term arises from the need to maintain a perfectly ordered priority queue of tentative distances — a process fundamentally tied to sorting. This "sorting barrier" was widely believed to be unavoidable in deterministic computation.

Randomized methods in the 2020s challenged this assumption by achieving sub-O(m+nlogn) performance in expectation. Yet, their reliance on probabilistic guarantees left open the fundamental question: *can deterministic algorithms do better?* The 2025 breakthrough by Duan et al. provides a compelling answer, shattering a sixty-year-old barrier.

## Historical Background

The development of shortest path algorithms can be understood as a gradual evolution in balancing efficiency, generality, and determinism.

![Algorithm Milestones Timeline](/research-images/dijkstra/math-images/image006.png)
*Figure 1: Milestones in single-source shortest paths (SSSP)*

- **1958 — Bellman-Ford**: Introduced as a general algorithm capable of handling negative weights. Its runtime of O(mn) is prohibitive in practice, particularly for sparse graphs.
- **1959 — Dijkstra**: A more efficient solution for non-negative weights, achieving O(m+nlogn). Its reliance on strict priority queue ordering tied it inherently to sorting.
- **1980s-1990s — Heap Optimizations**: Advances in data structures, such as Fibonacci heaps and pairing heaps, reduced constants but failed to escape the logn overhead.
- **2020s — Randomized Breakthroughs**: Works presented at FOCS 2022 and STOC 2024 achieved runtimes below O(m+nlogn), but only with high probability.
- **2025 — Deterministic Barrier Broken**: Duan et al. achieve O(m(log)^(2/3)n), the first deterministic improvement in more than half a century.

## The 2025 Breakthrough

The key result of Duan et al. (2025) is a deterministic algorithm for SSSP on directed graphs with non-negative edge weights that runs in O(m (log)^(2/3) n) time under the comparison-addition model.

At a high level, the algorithm avoids the full precision of global sorting. Instead, it employs a layered relaxation process that groups vertices into structured intervals. By relaxing vertices in batches rather than strict order, the algorithm ensures correctness while reducing dependence on priority queue operations.

This result is significant for two reasons. First, it breaks a barrier that had withstood sixty-five years of research, proving that shortest path computation is not inherently tied to sorting. Second, it restores balance in the field by showing that deterministic methods can compete with—and surpass—randomized approaches.

## Analysis & Conceptual Contrast

The contrast between Dijkstra's classical algorithm and the 2025 breakthrough is more than a matter of complexity bounds; it is a difference in *algorithmic worldview*. Dijkstra embodies a sorting-driven paradigm: every iteration hinges on extracting the globally minimum tentative distance from a priority queue, then relaxing its outgoing edges. This exact global ordering is what guarantees correctness, but it also anchors the algorithm's runtime to the cost of maintaining a fully sorted structure.

By contrast, the new approach of Duan et al. embraces *approximate ordering*. Instead of insisting on a perfectly sorted priority queue, vertices are grouped into *layers or intervals* that represent approximate distance ranges. Within each layer, vertices are relaxed in batches rather than individually, and only when finer distinctions become necessary are groups refined. This subtle shift eliminates the need for strict global ordering at every step, while still preserving the correctness of the final distances.

![Conceptual contrast between Dijkstra and deterministic layered approach](/research-images/dijkstra/math-images/image011.png)
*Figure 2: Conceptual contrast: Dijkstra's global sorting vs. deterministic layered relaxations*

This illustration captures the conceptual leap: shortest paths do not require perfect sorting. By reducing reliance on global order, the new approach cuts the logarithmic factor while preserving determinism.

### Runtime Growth Comparison

The asymptotic implications of this shift are depicted in the following schematic. On sparse graphs (where m≈n), Bellman-Ford's quadratic growth quickly becomes infeasible, while Dijkstra's O(nlogn) runtime dominated the deterministic frontier for decades. Randomized methods dip just below Dijkstra, but only in expectation. Duan et al.'s O(m(log)^(2/3)n curve lies beneath Dijkstra's, demonstrating the first provable deterministic improvement.

![Runtime growth comparison of shortest path algorithms](/research-images/dijkstra/math-images/image014.png)
*Figure 3: Schematic runtime growth (log-log) (Curves illustrate asymptotics)*

This schematic underscores the long-term impact: while the absolute gain may be modest for small instances, asymptotically the separation grows. It positions the 2025 algorithm as a new **theoretical baseline** for deterministic SSSP.

### Complexity Landscape

Traditional algorithms reflect fundamentally different philosophies. Bellman-Ford embodies brute-force relaxation, guaranteeing correctness even with negative weights but at prohibitive cost. Dijkstra epitomizes greedy optimization, but is chained to sorting through its priority queue. Randomized methods introduced in the 2020s sidestepped exact ordering, but only by gambling on probability, leaving open whether determinism could compete.

Duan et al.'s contribution is the first to show that **determinism can break the glass ceiling**: shortest paths do not require perfect sorting. By grouping vertices and processing them in carefully structured layers, the algorithm achieves progress without precise global order.

### Algorithm Comparison Table

| Algorithm | Year | Runtime | Handles Negatives? | Deterministic/Randomized | Practical Relevance |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| Bellman-Ford | 1958 | ![B-F runtime](/research-images/dijkstra/math-images/image007.png) | Yes | Deterministic | Correct but impractical for large graphs |
| Dijkstra | 1959 | ![Dijkstra O](/research-images/dijkstra/math-images/image001.png) | No | Deterministic | Long-standing baseline for sparse graphs |
| Heap Optimizations | 1980s-90s | ![heap log](/research-images/dijkstra/math-images/image001.png) | No | Deterministic | Improved performance but same asymptotic bound |
| Randomized SSSP | 2022-24 | ![rand runtime](/research-images/dijkstra/math-images/image001.png) | No | Randomized | Theoretical progress, less robust in practice |
| **Duan et al.** | **2025** | ![breakthrough O](/research-images/dijkstra/math-images/image002.png) | **No** | **Deterministic** | **First deterministic breakthrough in 65+ years** |

The illustration is not pseudocode, but captures the **conceptual leap**: shortest paths do not require perfect sorting. By reducing reliance on global order, the new approach cuts the logarithmic factor while preserving determinism.

## Critical Reflections

Despite its historic contribution, the 2025 breakthrough is not without boundaries. A deeper look reveals both strengths and caveats:

1. **Weight Restrictions**: Like Dijkstra's algorithm, the new method requires non-negative edge weights. Extending determinism beyond this constraint — to handle negative weights efficiently — remains an open frontier.

2. **Asymptotic vs. Practical Efficiency**: The runtime improvement from O(m+nlogn) to O(m(log)^(2/3)n) is asymptotically elegant. However, hidden constants may blunt practical gains on real-world graphs of modest size. The true test will come with implementations.

3. **Conceptual Victory**: Most importantly, the algorithm severs the assumed equivalence between deterministic shortest paths and sorting. This is a philosophical shift: shortest paths are no longer chained to global ordering.

Taken together, these reflections show that while the breakthrough's practical impact is yet to unfold, its **theoretical significance is undeniable**. It not only surpasses a long-standing runtime barrier but also reshapes our understanding of what is possible in deterministic graph algorithms.

## Future Directions and Speculation

The immediate open question is whether the exponent in O(m(log)^(2/3)n) can be reduced further, potentially reaching O(m). Another direction concerns extending the approach to graphs with negative weights, a capability that would unify efficiency with generality. Dynamic graphs, which better model real-world networks, present another frontier.

Beyond shortest paths, this work underscores a broader lesson: algorithmic barriers are not always fundamental. If sorting is not intrinsic to shortest path computation, what other problems, that are long believed and settled, might be waiting for re-examination?

## Conclusion

The 2025 breakthrough by Duan, Mao, Mao, Shu, and Yin dismantles a conceptual barrier that shaped our understanding of shortest path algorithms for over sixty years. By achieving a deterministic runtime of O(m(log)^(2/3)n), the result reaffirms that even the most classical algorithmic problems can yield new surprises. For the theory of algorithms, it is both a milestone and an invitation: to question long-held assumptions and to seek further advances where none were thought possible.
